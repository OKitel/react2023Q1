### How to setup .env

My app depends on api.unsplash.com. Authentication is required for this API. It's free but anyway you need to be authorized, to make a request to the API.

[Here I asked about authorization for reviewers in the form Q&A](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15FI4qtxQI3P43ZK-fHoE2BVMReToTWIB78Y7Of81GOA/edit#gid=1387685555&range=D17)

For security, I put my access token into the local .env file. So it is not committed to a public GitHub repo.

Here are instructions, on how to gain your own access token and make the app work:

Here are instructions, on how to gain your own access token and make the app work:

1. Go to [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/join) and create your account
2. Once you've created your account, use this [link](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications) to get to the new app setups. Click on the "New Application" button to create a new application. You need to accept the terms of use.
3. Give your application a name, and description. (Could be something like: name "react playground", description: "My application is an educational project for The Rolling Scopes School", **permissions: Public access**).
4. After creating the application, you should see a screen with your **Keys**ðŸ”‘. Please copy your **Access Key**
5. Now, all you need is to put your access token inside .example.env file instead of the placeholder "PLEASE_INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" and don't forget to rename the file to .env only.
6. That's it! Now you are an authorized user for api.unsplash.com and can check my application.
